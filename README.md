# Deep Learning Portfolio
This repository is my comprehensive collection of tools, resources, projects and projects' documentations related to Deep Learning and it serves as my portfolio for Deep learning and computer vision

# Key_Features
1. Data preparation
2. Deep learning for computer vision and other relavent tasks
3. Optimization and Evaluations of models
4. Use of Pre-trained models and Transfer learning

# Task_Statement
For each and every task in this repository, a document (Task statement) is given that shares important details, required libraries, Task requirements and Link to Datasets for the Task. This will be helpful for reproducibility of the task, if you want to reproduce it.

# Datasets
Datasets used for different tasks are either public or created. For public datasets, links are given in task statement. For created datasets they are placed in dataset folder.

# Projects
1. Bone Fracture detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
