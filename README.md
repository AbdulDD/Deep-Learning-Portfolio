# ML_Internship_Eziline_Software_House
This repository acts as my Portfolio for the Internship I have done in Machine Learning tachnology at Eziline Software house, Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan.

# Key_Features
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms and models
3. Optimization and Evaluations of models
4. Use of Pre-trained models and Transfer learning

# Task_Statement
For each and every task in this repository, a document (Task statement) is given that shares important details, required libraries, Task requirements and Link to Datasets for the Task. This will be helpful for reproducibility of the task, if you want to reproduce it.

# Datasets
Datasets used for different tasks are either public or created. For public datasets, links are given in task statement. For created datasets they are placed in dataset folder.

# Projects
1. Comparing CNN and VGnet: Two DL models for Bone Fracture Detection problem
2. Spam Email Classification using Naive Bayes algorithm
